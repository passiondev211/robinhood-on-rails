# Robinhood on Rails
Robinhood on Rails is a simple front end for the free trading platform [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/).

## DISCLAIMER
This app relies on the private API as found [here](https://github.com/sanko/Robinhood). It isn't recommended to use this since the API is private and can change unexpectedly at any time, and is not officially supported.

### Influences and references
Thanks to Jeffrey Smith for his [designs](https://dribbble.com/shots/2619026-Robinhood-Web-App-Concept-V2) which I based a lot of the front end work off of.
